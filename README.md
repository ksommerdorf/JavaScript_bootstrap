# UFO Analysis
## Overview of Project
Dana, a journalist, has been tasked with writing about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. She wanted to focus on UFO sighting because it is what her town is known for and the town has annual events for UFO enthusiasts gatherings. Dana wanted to post her article on a HTML page with a table of data to support her findings and interactive filters to narrow down data for the user.
